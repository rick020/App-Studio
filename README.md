# rickbruins problemset1

- The main code is located in the rickbruins-pset1/ViewController.swift file.
- The userface file is called rickbruins-pset1/Main.storyboard 

Our assignment1 was to build an app called "Mr. Potato Head". The toy has several accessories and body parts that can be placed on it, such as eyes, nose, mouth, ears, hat, shoes, and so on.
The app should display only the toy's body, but if the user checks/unchecks any of the checkboxes below the toy, the corresponding body part or accessory should appear/disappear.
